# Switcher

Do you ever play on a server where you have /gamemode permissions but not operator permissions? 
For the vanilla gamemode switcher you need operator permissions, which means you can't use it and have to type 
"/gamemode ABC" all the time. This small client-side mod fixes this problem by removing the permission check when 
opening the gamemode switcher.

Download it on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/switcher/versions) or install it with [pacmc](https://github.com/jakobkmar/pacmc): `pacmc install switcher`.
